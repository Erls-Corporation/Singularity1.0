        SEO Secret</h1>
    <p>
        For a good SEO, you should know how serach engine indexer works? However, this is
        exactly what we do not know! that is &quot;currently&quot; how Google, MSN or Yahoo
        indexer works. If you are not already familiar with Indexer, you should know that
        Search Engine has three main software components: Crawler, Indexer and Serach Page.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Crawler</b>, finds new web pages and obtains text, URLs and other searchable
        information from it. Using URLs on page, crawler find even more web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crawler supplies page link, text and URLs to <b>Indexer</b>. Indexer applies algorithms
        (or search standards) on this data to create a database of words and word pairs
        to page link.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, <b>Search Page</b> is where people could search indexed information and
        find relavent web pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this article, we will be larning about search standards.</p>

        How to Start SEO?</h1>
    <p>
        SEO is a process to verify your pages against <strong>search standards</strong>.
        There are no search standards per sa, but tips and tricks to improve the quality
        of searchable contents and site ranking. Following are some key areas to start SEO:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.1 validation</li>
        <li>Download Time Optimization</li>
        <li>Keyword Research</li>
        <li>Meta Tags</li>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Page Contents</li>
        <li>Image alt Attribute</li>
        <li>Search Engine Friendly Links</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
        XHTML 1.0 &amp; CSS 2.1 Validation</h1>
    <p>
        Cleaner pages results in better ranking and shorter loading time. Check your web
        pages for <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check">XHTML 1.0 compliance</a> and for
        <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS 2.1 compliance</a> at W3C website.
        One way to remove all errors and warnings is to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Express/">
            download</a> a free Visual Web Developer Express edition and validate your page.
        A page is XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant only if there are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Proper closing tags e.g. &lt;img src=&quot;logo.gif&quot;&gt; vs. &lt;img src=&quot;logo.gif&quot;
            /&gt; </li>
        <li>&nbsp;Proper quotes e.g &lt;img src=logo.gif&gt; vs. &lt;img src=&quot;logo.gif&quot;
            /&gt; </li>
        <li>&nbsp;No attribute short writing e.g. &lt;option selected&gt; vs. &lt;option selected=&quot;selected“&gt;
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;Only lower case html elements and attributes. e.g. &lt;HTML&gt; vs. &lt;html&gt;</li>
        <li>&nbsp;&amp;, &gt;, &lt; etc. are escaped everywhere: title, body, alt and even in
            URLs. e.g. &gt; vs. &amp;gt;</li>
        <li>&nbsp;And many other things. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML1.0
            Transitional</a>&nbsp; specifications.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Check if website has valid HTML. One tool to validate HTML is <a href="http://online.htmlvalidator.com/php/onlinevallite.php"
            title="online.htmlvalidator.com/php/onlinevallite.php">HTML Validator</a>.</p>

    <h1>
        Download Time Optimization</h1>
    <p>
        If your web page takes long time to download, people will close browser window before
        it loads. Search engine keeps an eye and rank those pages higher that get more traffic.
        Apply following optimizations to imporve download time:
    </p>
    <h2>
        JavaScript Optimizations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Do not embed JavaScript in web page. Move all JavaScript in .js file and provide
            a link to .js file in page.</li>
        <li>Do not embed CSS styles in web page. Move styles in a separate .css file and use
            class attribute in web page.</li>
        <li>Avoid time costly redirects on page load.</li>
        <li>Do not use JavaScript window onload event use AJAX instead. If necessary, keep window
            onload to complete quickly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Image Optimizations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Images and flash are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span></strong>
            searchable and increase page load time. Avoid using images and flash.</li>
        <li>If necessary, use images and flash files that are optimizaed for size.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Content Optimization</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove unnecessary white spaces i.e &amp;nbsp; &lt;br/&gt; and &lt;p/&gt;. Also
            remove unnecessary tables, spans and div tags.</li>
        <li>As a general content guideline, if JavaScript, cookies, session IDs, frames, DHTML
            or Flash keep you from seeing all of your site in a text browser like <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=lynx+browser">
                Lynx</a>, then search engine spiders will have trouble crawling your site.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>
        Keyword Research</h1>
    <p>
        If your website <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">uses</span></strong>
        keywords that people use to search in Google, MSN or Yahoo, chances are, your site
        will appear in the first place or in top 5. Keyword research is a three step process:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understanding business behind website.</li>
        <li>Knowing Serach Trends (or what people are searching for).</li>
        <li>Keyword tools (to build keyword list).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Understanding Business behind Website</h2>
    <p>
        For keyword research, it is important to find out the purpose of website or more
        appropriately the <strong>business behind the website</strong>. So for example,
        <a href="http://www.holidayhypermarket.co.uk">www.holidayhypermarket.co.uk</a> sells
        holiday packages online. They provide cheap holiday and wedding packages for many
        regions, but specifically for Spain, Caribbean and Dubai. Knowing this information
        helps you finding right keywords and there by right traffic for website. Also visit
        website with similar theme.</p>
    <h2>
        Knowing Search Trends</h2>
    <p>
        Use following tools to research what people are currently searching for or buying:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="http://www.google.com/trends">Google Trends</a> </li>
        <li><a href="http://trends.google.com/websites">Trends for Websites</a></li>

        <li><a href="http://www.metaspy.com/info.metac.spy/metaspy/filtered.htm">MetaCrawler</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="http://searchenginez.com/spy.html">SearchEnginez.com</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Lookup for alternate search suggestion to improve quality of keywords.:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="http://search.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Search</a></li>

    <h1>
        Meta Tags</h1>
    <h2>
        &lt;meta&gt; Keywords</h2>
    <p>
        All your keyword research effort is to create a &lt;meta&gt; keyword tag as shown
        below:</p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: #800080">&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;bargain
            holidays,cheap holidays,cheap flights,family holidays,last minute holidays,last
            minute,late deals,holidays in,holidays to,holiday hypermarket,cheap holiday,cheap
            package holidays,&quot; /&gt;</span></p>
    <p>
        Do not repeat keywords for better ranking as most engines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_stuffing">
            punish this</a>. There are some engines that create their own keyword from page
        text. So alone keywords can not do a magic.</p>
    <h2>
        &lt;meta&gt; Description</h2>
    <p>
        Create a &lt;meta&gt; description tag as shown below. Search engines have keywords
        and description limits and truncate characters after certain length. Character with
        spacing limit varies with time/engine from 100-300 characters. As this description
        appears in Search Engine Result Page (SERP), so it should clearly tells the purpose
        of web page.</p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: #800080">&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Book
            cheap holidays online at Holiday Hypermarket. Millions of package holiday bargains,
            last minute deals, cheap flights and all inclusive holidays to book online.&quot;
            /&gt;</span></p>
    <h1>
        Title
    </h1>
    <p>
        With correct keyword selection, chances are that people will click to navigate your
        website. I said chances, becuase click through depends on the quality of web page
        title and its description that appears in Search Engine Result Page (SERP). At times,
        people do not click first or second site in SERP because of poor title and description.
        Provide an title that uses keywords as shown below:</p>
    <p>
        <span style="color: #800080">&lt;title&gt;Holiday Packages | Wedding Holiday Packages
            | Dubai | Florida | Middle East | Europe | Caribbean | Far East &lt;/title&gt;</span>

        Using Related Keywords</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Use keyword and related keywords in content. </li>
        <li>For example, if your website sells "digital camera" then you <strong>must also use</strong>
            related words like "canon digital camera", "kodak digital camera", "olympus digital
            camera", "digital camera prices digital video camera", "samsung digital camera",
            "sony", "nikon". </li>
        <li>You could find related keywords at the end of Google search result page.</li>

    <h1>
        Why &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; are Important?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Important contents containing keywords should appear at the top of the page. </li>
        <li>Headings, paragraphs and bullet list makes helps search engines to find keywords
            and index your webpage for those keywords. </li>
        <li>Page contents should use keywords in &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt; and text. This will
            make page &quot;relavent&quot; to title, keywords and description and will result
            in better search engine ranking.</li>
        <li>Use a text browser such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=lynx+browser">
            Lynx</a> to examine what searchable contents are available on your site. Search
            engine crawlers see your site much as Lynx would.</li>

        Image alt Attribute</h1>
    <p>
        Make sure to specify &lt;img&gt; tag&nbsp; <strong>alt</strong> attribute that uses
        "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">keywords</span></strong>". Consider
        following &lt;img&gt; tags for an SEO consultancy:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;img src="seo-consultant.jpg" alt="seo &amp; website consultants"/&gt; is more
            searchable and relavent to a SEO consultancy as compared to &lt;img src="sc.jpg"
            alt="image sc.jpg"/&gt; or &lt;img src="sc.jpg"/&gt;.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Note that, contents being searchable (sc vs. seo-consultant) and relavent (software
            house vs. seo-consultant) are two different things. Using keywords makes content
            both searchable and relavent.<?xml namespace="" prefix="O" ?></li>

        <b>cheap-dubai-holiday-package-1345.aspx</b> is more searchable as compared to <b>hp.aspx?d=1345</b>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write a software component that generates and translates SEO friendly URLs. </li>
        <li>Try to name image, flash and other files such that they include keywords. <strong>
            dc.jpg</strong> is not searchable and irrelavent to an online digital camera website
            as compared to <strong>digital-camera.jpg</strong>.</li>
        <li>Hyperlinks could have the title tag having keywords.e.g. &lt;a href="http://RafeySoft.com/"

        Link Building</h1>
    <p>
        Search engines rank websites based on in bound links coming from reputable and heavy
        traffic websites. Search engines consider a technical website "more relavent" if
        it has inbound links coming from microsoft.com or ibm.com. Do following to create
        quality inbound links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Submit articles to relavent websites, post blog entries and write to forums containing
            inbound links.</li>
        <li>Create "quality" inbound links containing <strong>keywords</strong>. &lt;a href="http://digitalworld.com/digital-camera.aspx"&gt;<strong>More
            about Digital Camera</strong>&lt;/a&gt; is more relavent to an online digital camera
            website as compared to&lt;a href="http://digitalworld.com/dc.aspx"&gt;<strong>Click
                Link</strong>&lt;/a&gt; because fomer contains keyword "Digital Camera".</li>
        <li>Link building not only increases your website ranking but also brings more traffic
            from other sites.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
        Link Exchange</h1>
    <p>
        Search engines gives higher ranking to websites that are popular. Contact web masters
        of reputable websites and discuss with them how you could link their products and
        services on your website. In return ask them to place your website link on their
        site. <strong>Do not over do</strong> link exchange with irelavent websites, as
        search engines punish it by removing your website from index. It is good idea to
        conduct a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_campaign">Link Campaign</a>.</p>
    <h1>
        Website Group</h1>
    <p>
        Search engines gives higher ranking to relavent websites. Google describes relaveny
        as:</p>
    <p>
        "<em>Relevancy is determined by over 200 factors, one of which is the PageRank for a
            given page. PageRank is the measure of the importance of a page based on the incoming
            links from other pages. In simple terms, each link to a page on your site from another
            site adds to your site's PageRank.</em>".
    </p>
    <p>
        One way of increasing PageRank is to do as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a group of related websites and link them to main website. A website selling
            holiday packages could have a main website that sells vacation packages for all
            regions and indivdual websites for Florida, Dubai, Spain and Europe packages. </li>
        <li>You should create 10-12 free websites and 2-5 paid websites to get better PageRank.
        </li>
        <li>Again <strong>do not over do</strong> website grouping so that it becomes <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_farm">Link Farm</a>, a mal-practice, that
            search engines punish by removing your website from index. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Following are some of places where you could create free websites. Do you own research
        for free websites <strong>without</strong> popups and ads:</p>

        domain name, urls, content, inbound links and keywords. However, consider following
        while choosing a hosting company:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Search engines prefer site hosted in USA to one in UK for USA related keywords like
            California. </li>
        <li>Hosting companies that are black listed by search engines for spamming and artificial
            link building will lower website ranking. </li>
        <li>For dedicated hosting, check if your IP is earlier used by some blacklisted site.
        </li>
        <li>Website up time affects ranking. Research, quality of services for hosting company.
        </li>
        <li>When you switch hosting company, downtime has an affect on ranking. Plan to keep

            How to use AdWords</h1>
        <p>
            The AdWords system calculates a 'Quality Score' for each of your keywords. It looks
            at a variety of factors to measure how relevant your keyword is to your ad text
            and to a user's search query. A keyword's Quality Score updates frequently and is
            closely related to its performance. In general, a high Quality Score means that
            your keyword will trigger ads in a higher position and at a lower cost-per-click
            (CPC).</p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;<a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6111">Ad placement</a>
            will still be dependent on Quality Score, your cost-per-click (CPC) bid, your budget
            and account settings, and user and advertiser behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clickthrough rate (CTR) is the number of clicks your ad receives divided by the
            number of times your ad is shown (impressions) via Google search only. For example,
            a well targeted keyword that shows a similarly targeted ad is more likely to have
            a higher CTR than a general keyword with non-specific ad text. you can use CTR to
            gauge which ads and keywords aren't performing as well for you and then optimize
            them.

            Quality Score</h1>
        <p>
            Quality Score for Google and the search network is a dynamic metric assigned to
            each of your keywords. It's calculated using a variety of factors and measures how
            relevant your keyword is to your ad group and to a user's search query. The higher
            a keyword's Quality Score, the lower its cost-per-clicks (CPCs) and the better its
            ad position. A Quality Score is calculated every time your keyword matches a search
            query -- that is, every time your keyword has the potential to trigger an ad. Quality
            Score is used in several different ways, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>influencing your keywords' <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6297">
                actual cost-per-clicks (CPCs)</a> </li>
            <li>estimating the <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=105665">
                first page bids</a> that you see in your account </li>
            <li>determining if a keyword is eligible to enter the ad auction that occurs when a
                user enters a search query </li>
            <li>affecting how high your <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6111">
                ad will be ranked</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In general, the higher your Quality Score, the lower your costs and the better your
            ad position.

            </ul>
            <p>
                Note that there are slight variations to the Quality Score formula when it affects
                ad position and first page bid:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>
                </p>
                <li><strong>For calculating a keyword-targeted ad's position,</strong> landing page
                    quality is not a factor. Also, when calculating ad position on a search network
                    placement, Quality Score considers the CTR on that particular placement in addition
                    to CTR on Google.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>For calculating first page bid,</strong> Quality Score doesn't consider
                    the matched ad or search query, since this estimate appears as a metric in your
                    account and doesn't vary per search query.</li>

            Landing page's load time</h1>
        <p>
            From April 2008, you'll be able to see a grade for your landing page's load time
            in your AdWords account. 'Load time' refers to the amount of time that it takes
            for a user to view your <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=14086">
                landing page</a> after clicking your ad.
        </p>
        <p>
            We evaluate your load time relative to the average in your server's geographic region.
            If your website is hosted on a server in India, for example, your landing page load
            time will be compared to the average load time in that region of India. This is
            true even if your website is intended for an audience in the United Kingdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that your Quality Score may be updated incrementally over a number of weeks
            after you improve your load time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Landing page load time is determined by:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>I. The domain of your ad group's landing pages</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            A keyword's <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=87144">load
                time grade</a> is based on the average load time of the <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=14086">
                    landing pages</a> in the ad group and of any landing pages in the rest of
            the account with the same <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=14845">
                domain</a>. If multiple ad groups have landing pages with the same domain, therefore,
            the keywords in all these ad groups will have identical load time grades.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two things to note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When determining load time grade, the AdWords system follows <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6313">
                destination URLs</a> at both the ad and <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=52155">
                    keyword</a> level and evaluates the final landing page. </li>
            <li>If your ad group contains landing pages with different domains, the keywords' load
                time grades will be based on the domain with the slowest load time. All the keywords
                in an ad group will always have the same load time grade.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Let's look at an example:
        </p>
        <p>
            Say your account has four ad groups, and each ad group uses a different landing
            page: example.com/apple, example.com/orange, example.com/pear, and your-company-site.com.
            The first three share the same domain: example.com. Keywords in the first three
            ad groups will all have the same landing page load time grade, which will be based
            on the average load time of example.com/apple, example.com/orange, and example.com/pear.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>II. Your server's geographic region</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We evaluate your load time relative to the average in your server's geographic region.
            If your website is hosted on a server in India, for example, your landing page load
            time will be compared to the average load time in that region of India. This is
            true even if your website is intended for an audience in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>III. Your page's HTML</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, landing page load time measures the time it takes to download the HTML
            content of your landing page. However, in the future, the load time of images, flash,
            video, JavaScript, and other components will be considered as well. We therefore
            recommend that you <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=93116">
                optimize all components of your page</a> for the quickest possible load time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>IV. Multiple readings</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure accuracy, we take several load time measurements, drop the worst, and
            average those remaining. If your landing page is down for one of these readings,
            therefore, it won't affect your load time grade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keyword-targeted ads are ranked on search pages based on a combination of the matched
            keyword's CPC bid and Quality Score. Quality Score is determined by the keyword's
            clickthrough rate (CTR) on Google, relevance of ad text, historical keyword performance,
            landing page, and other relevancy factors.
        </p>

            CPM vs CPC</h1>
        <p>
            Advertisers have told us that CPM pricing is a tool they like to have available
            for their AdWords campaigns. Some advertisers want the flexibility to reach customers
            early in the advertising cycle, with ads designed to increase awareness but not
            necessarily generate clicks or traffic. Others prefer the traditional industry metrics
            of CPM campaigns. As a result, AdWords has made CPM pricing available to those who
            prefer it.</p>
        <p>
            The AdWords discounter automatically reduces any winning CPM bid so that the amount
            charged is the minimum necessary to keep the ad's position on the page.CPM bidding
            is available only in campaigns that <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=87783">
                don't target the search network</a>. CPM ads are ranked for display according
            to their CPM bid, competing with other CPM ads and with CPC ads. A CPM ad always
            occupies the entire ad space, with either an image ad or other multimedia ad, or
            an <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=18272">expanded text
                ad</a>.

            Getting Google visibility and advertising are two different things. In order to
            be found at the top of Google's rankings, you do not also have to advertise. SEO
            is what is described in this article and it helps in getting better ranking. However
            if an ad makes website popular then search engines note it and results in better
